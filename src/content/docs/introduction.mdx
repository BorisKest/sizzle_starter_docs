## Problem

Every developer has a routine of authoring the same code for each new project.
Every developer has a set of libraries and tools that they use in every project.
The task of establishing the structure and architecture of a new project
is time-consuming and boring. It is also error-prone. A few days can be easily spent.

### Solution

So, I decided to create a template that covers the most common needs
of a flutter developer. I also wanted to create a template that is well-documented
and easy to understand. I hope that this template will save you a lot of time.

The Sizzle Starter comes with:

- [x] ThemeScope that manages the theme: light, dark, system or custom.
- [x] LocalizationScope that manages the localization.
- [x] Well-defined initialization process.
- [x] Dependency Injection.
- [x] Guide to the project structure and architecture.
- [x] CI/CD configuration for GitHub Actions.
- [x] Package for unified network requests.
- [x] Package for local database management using Drift.
- [x] Examples of full-blown applications built with Sizzle Starter.

Each topic is covered in a separate guide. You can find the list of guides in
the sidebar.
