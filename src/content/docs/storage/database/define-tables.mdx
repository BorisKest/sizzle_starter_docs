To work with data in SQLite databases, it is needed to define
**tables** that represent the data first. This page shows how to do it
in Drift.

## Defining tables

There are two ways to define a table in Drift - using Dart code or using
SQL code. Dart code is easier, but SQL code is more powerful and decouples
the table definition from the Dart code.

### Primary Key

Primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify a row
in a table. It is used to enforce uniqueness of rows and to reference
rows from other tables.
