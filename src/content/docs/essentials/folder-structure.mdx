title: "Folder Structure"
description: "Еhe optimal file and folder organization within the Sizzle Starter architecture."
---

When it comes to software development, the organization of files and folders is paramount.
A structured and intuitive directory can be the difference between a smoothly operating project and a tangled mess.
In Sizzle Starter, we've honed a systematic approach to project organization.
If you're uncertain about file placements or inter-feature dependencies, this guide is for you.

## Folder Hierarchy: A Bird's-Eye View

Here’s the overarching structure:

```text
.
└── src - Root of all source code
    ├── core - Bedrock utilities and configurations
    │   ├── assets - Static and generated asset files
    │   │   └── generated
    │   ├── localization - Language files and auto-generated translations
    │   │   └── translations
    │   └── utils - General purpose utility functions
    └── feature - Modular feature containers
        └── feature1
            ├── data - Repositories, data sources, etc.
            ├── bloc - Business logic components
            ├── model - Data Transfer Objects, Entities, and more
            └── widget - UI components like screens and widgets
    main.dart - The application's entry point
```

### Diving Deeper into Core

The `core` directory is the heart of your application.
It houses utilities and configurations that provide functionality across multiple features. Here are some examples:

- **Mixins and Extensions:** Commonly used functions or properties that can be mixed into classes.
- **Rest Client:** Standardized configurations and methods for API requests.
- **BLoC Observer:** Debugging and monitoring tool for the BLoC pattern.

### Dissecting Feature

A feature-based architecture, as employed by Sizzle Starter,
encapsulates related functionalities within self-contained modules,
streamlining development and maintenance.

Advantages of such an approach include:

- **Maintainability:** Features are compartmentalized, making it easier to locate and update code.
    It becomes easier to work in teams, as developers can focus on their respective features.
- **Predictability:** Features are self-contained, and it is clear where to find specific code.
    This makes it easier to onboard new developers.

Let’s inspect a couple of these:

```text
.
└── feature
    ├── cart
    │   ├── data
    │       ├── cart_data_source.dart
    │   │   └── cart_repository.dart
    │   ├── bloc
    │   │   └── cart_bloc.dart
    │   ├── model
    │   │   └── cart.dart
    │   └── widget
    │       └── cart_screen.dart
    └── authentication
        ├── data
        │   ├── authentication_data_source.dart
        │   └── authentication_repository.dart
        ├── bloc
        │   └── authentication_bloc.dart
        ├── model
        │   └── user.dart
        └── widget
            └── authentication_screen.dart
```

These modules are highly compartmentalized:

- **Data:** The backend of the feature-encompassing repositories, data sources, and other similar entities.
- **BLoC:** Houses the business logic components, mediating between data and Widget.
- **Model:** Defines the structure of your data, from DTOs to entities.
- **Widget:** Contains all components pertinent to the feature.

:::tip
When a feature requires entities or logic from another feature,
it's tempting to relocate that code. Resist the urge!
Instead, import the necessary components.
This retains the modularity and intent of the original structure.

:::danger
Avoid impulsively moving files to the `core` directory.
It's not a dumping ground.

Remember: just because multiple features use a file doesn't
automatically qualify it for the `core` category.

In conclusion, while the Sizzle Starter structure is rigorous,
it’s designed for clarity and scalability. By understanding and adhering to its principles,
you'll be better equipped to build and maintain large-scale applications.
